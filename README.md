# assets

This repository serves as a centralized storage for visual aid assets that can be referenced across the internet.

It contains:

- **Media files**: mp4, png, jpeg, and gif files for direct embedding and linking
- **Source files**: Original creation files (e.g., PowerPoint presentations) used to generate the media assets

These assets are stored here to provide stable, accessible URLs for documentation, presentations, and other content hosted elsewhere.
